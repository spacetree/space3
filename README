# 1. About spatial3
#-------------------------------------------
spatial3(tree) is created to support met.no needs with concepts like planar geometry together with coressponding algorithms and operations.
spatial3 will keep its API as simple as possible, based on the actual user needs at the Norwegian Meteorological Institute.

With that purpose in mind, the implementation of space3 will be based on GESO and SpatiaLite libraries.

Those backends are seen as implementation detail and could be easily swapped. SpatiLite will be used to temporary store the geometries and
to provide efficient queries with it's spatial indexing capabilities.

Depends on:
GEOS
GEOS_C
SQLLite and SpatiLite amalgam files
